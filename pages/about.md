## The Family  
Growing up with a single-mother and a father with heavy addiction problems taught me something impactful about being a man, father and about family values in general. 

After seeking out father figures throghout my childhood, youth and even well into adulthood, I realised it was a dead-end path. My true Father has already blessed me with the light to become one myself.

This means my mission in life is to grow the kingdom here on earth, and that earthly kingdom starts with me and my family. 

I consider myself a humble husband and a [non-conformist](https://chrisguillebeau.com/non-conformist). I'm married to Susana who I met at a party in my 20s and we were blessed with 4 kids who were born -15,-17,-19 and in 2024. 

## The Movement Practice
We are not brains in jars, but blessed with bodies to experience the world to its full extent. Whether we were gifted with strong legs, long arms or nimble necks, we all find our ways to still our minds through movement. 

After learning deeply about our human abilities to renew our minds through movement, with [Ido Portal](https://www.idoportal.com/) during 2017-2019 I got a new perspective on fitness, physical performance and on health in general. 

To keep it short: I am glad I have kids to be inspired from. Incorporating movement in our daily habits is key for a sustainable lifestyle, and having dirty walls at home after doing handstands is not a bad thing after all. Let them dirty the walls!

In 2022 I put my oldest son on brazilian jiujitsu practice and since then I have also joined and am hooked for a lifelong journey to learn more about my own body but also a bit more about organic strength, energy conservation and body mechanics. Very valuable practice.

## Platform Plumbing
I work as a platform engineer in the banking industry. Focusing on improving the developer experience. A lot of time is spent updating infrastructure code, pipelines and security settings. There is also some meetings to attend and some docs to update. But mainly I am working with automating pipelines and platforms so that it becomes more secure, moore smooth and a little more fun to build and deploy business applications in the bank.

## Solopreneurship
I'm the creator of [Maker Mode](https://makermode.dev/), an online developer agency. Helping small businesses and digital entrepreneurs to build better products. I also write a newsletter to share the best insights on how to run a one-person business. This is a lifelong journey. I tend to love to play the long game. Just like my jiujitsu practice. 

## Why TheNimblegeek?

"Being agile" became a business buzzword that didn't resonate with me any longer. It became too industrialized. A more natural state was to strive to be nimble. With a strong and solid base of skills, values and ethos we should also be able to quickly adapt to new circumstances and situations. Without loosing the core values and principles. 

#### Being Nimble
Look at the bamboo stick. It is bendy, yet flexible. It is long-lasting and adaptive. That is how we want to approach our worklife.

As I was working in developement teams for more than ten years and realized that one of the single most successful traits was to learn fast and apply the learnings quickly.

#### Being Geeky
I'm not sure when my curiosity for technology was born but today I have a close to an obsession to learn new technologies. Whether it is a new programming language or a framework I found it useful to learn the foundations, even though we have smart AI tools that do most of the heavy lifting for us. We live in a tech driven world so learning to code has been like learning a new language. I need to be able to speak machine to understand what is going on...

Writing is an important part of my life experience. The habit and ritual of writing helps me think. It also helps me to solve problems and navigate throughout my various roles. 

#### Where I hang out...
I try to be intentional with using online platforms and currently there is a lot of focus on building software and writing, so [the links on this site](https://2e6ca809-1dcc-44c4-a9fa-c5893b5543ed-00-3c42rje3zdfkx.janeway.replit.dev/) give you a solid picture where I spend most my time.

I usually [hangout on X](https://x.com/thenimblegeek), that's where you can find me and you can always say hey by sending a mail to: heyjas@hey.com
