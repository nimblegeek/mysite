My name is Jonas Achouri Sihl√©n. 

I work as a platform engineer in the financial service industry and I'm the creator of [Maker Mode](https://makermode.dev/), an online developer agency. Helping small businesses and digital entrepreneurs to build better products.

I'm not sure when my curiosity for technology was born but today I have a close to an obsession to learn new technologies. Whether it is a new programming language or a framework I found it useful to learn the foundations, even though we have smart AI tools that do most of the heavy lifting for us. We live in a tech driven world so learning to code has been like learning a new language. I need to be able to speak machine to understand what is going on...

Writing is an important part of my life experience. The habit and ritual of writing helps me think. It also helps me to solve problems and navigate throughout my various roles. 

On a personal note, my main mission in life is to foster, lead and grow my family. I consider myself a humble husband and a non-conformist who put my closest family first. I'm married to Susana who I met at a party in my 20s and we were blessed with 4 kids, born -15,-17,-19 and 2024.
