What if we got this learning-to-code thing wrong? I say what if since I am not one hundred percent certain yet.  

The traditional way of learning has been to study theory, watch lectures, make notes, and go through labs and exercises to iterate on what you have learned, mostly from a book or a teacher. 

At college, we were taught to study for exams and were encouraged to work through seminars that didn't have too much to do with reality. But we live in different times now.   

Technology has enabled us to build and ship things so fast that we can shorten our learning loops so that we can learn much faster, with meaning.

One way to do it is through project based learning. So instead of being stuck in tutorials and looooong Udemy courses, start building small projects.   

By building small projects, you learn to do stuff instead of reading about doing stuff. And ultimately, this is what employers and customers pay you for. To do the work, to solve specific problems.  

With project-based learning, you will not only learn the particular technology much faster, but you will also learn about the things surrounding that technology. 

The isolated concepts and gaps you will face can be filled by reading books or taking a course on the side, to fill the gaps. Not to feed your self-directed hunger. You will only be disappointed. Go out and learn on your own terms. Build, ship, and grow. 

No one is built the same.
